var Morb00 = "SK8 was originally a funny kind of mockumentary Connor and I came up with. We wrote it for animation class but decided it would work better in live action. After trying to adapt the script we wanted to go into a more documentary style on the film and it worked way better. With interviews obviously about skating and the life of a person who skates. Along with this, I was able to make my music for the project which was a fun test of skill along with sequencing and editing.";

var Morb01 = "This shot takes place in the first act of the film. When we meet Connor we see him attempt a trick he seemingly keeps failing. At the end of the ark, he lands the trick and the film is underway. Intercut with interviews and music I produced it felt like a man with many hats. From the director, music producer, and even a cinematographer I loved having the agency to make the decisions I wanted with the vision I had. "

var morb02 = "I'd have to say that my favorite part of making this film was filming the motions of a skateboard. Trying to be creative with the way I could utilize a skateboard was a lot of fun and a unique challenge that I took with pride. Regardless of whether it worked or not, I loved the creative process. Creating a wide enough frame to encompass everything was a great challenge for me as someone who isn't savvy with a camera."

var morb03 = "For the third shot, I overlayed multiple Connor's and made them look like ghosts. I think the technique had the effect I was going for by making all past attempts ghosts of the past until the end of the shot where they all combine into one person as he lands the trick. I thought it was cool. "
